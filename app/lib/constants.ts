  In React, props and state are essential concepts for managing data within components. 
  Props (short for properties) are used to pass data from a parent component to a child component, 
  making components more reusable and modular. Since props are immutable, a child component cannot 
  modify them; it can only use the data passed from its parent. This is useful when a parent needs 
  to share information, such as a username or a theme preference, across multiple components. 
  State, on the other hand, is mutable and used to store and manage data locally within a component. 
  When the state of a component changes, React triggers a re-render to update the UI. 
  This is commonly used for interactive features like counters, form inputs, or toggles. 
  Understanding when to use props (for passing data) and state (for managing component behavior) is 
  crucial for writing efficient and scalable React applications.
